# Hacker Rank DiagonalDifference
➪ Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. 
For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

➪ The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.
## Return
➪ int: the absolute diagonal difference
## Note
➪ |x| is the absolute value of x
